# Hacker-Earth-competition
This respository contains code for a number of machine learning competitions organised by HackerEarth in 2017. Most of the competitions are classifcation problems with a relatively small number of features(under 10 features). The primary algorhithm for predictions is XGboost. It returns very reliable results. Data handling is done with Pandas and some data processing is done with Scikit-Learn
