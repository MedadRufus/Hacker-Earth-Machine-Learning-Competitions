# Hacker-Earth-competition
This respository contains code for a number of machine learning competitions organised by HackerEarth in 2017. Most of the competitions are classifcation problems with a relatively small number of features(under 10 features). The primary algorhithm for predictions is XGboost. It returns very reliable results.
